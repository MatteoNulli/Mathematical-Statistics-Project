# Mathematical-Statistics-Project
Mathematical Statistics project from November 2021 to January 2022.

This Statistics project focused on looking at data coming from the USA from 2016.
In particular the emphasis was put on looking for causation and correlation between the number of Trump voters,
the number of hate crimes and many other covariates such as the median household income and the share of unemployment. 
The analysis was made using R to inspect the data, 
make the relevant changes and to employ both multivariate linear regression models and the Analysis of variance (ANOVA).
